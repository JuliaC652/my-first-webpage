  <h1>My Favorite Places</h1>
  <p>
    I believe in traveling on a budget, and as a result, I have gotten to travel all over the world 
    (though Antarctica still won't hire me as a cook...yet). If you want to travel somewhere in the world,
    but you believe it's beyond your budget-- just email me at JuliaC652@yahoo.com and we will work on a plan
    to get you there. Where there's a will there's a way.
  </p>

  <p>Anyhow, I've gotten to travel to amazing places like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>England</li>
      <li>Ireland</li>
      <li>Canada</li>
      <li>Spain</li>
      <li>Denmark</li>
      <li>Sweden</li>
      <li>Finland</li>
      <li>Norway</li>
      <li>Peru</li>
      <li>South Africa</li>

    </ul>
  
  <h2>Highlights</h2>
    <p>
      I went to Oslo on July 22nd, 2011 and accidentally witnessed a terrorist bombing of the capital city.
      I made the mistake of reading <em>On The Road</em> by Jack Karouac right before going to an archaeology field school
      in Menorca, Spain so I ended up stupidly deciding to hitchhike and briefly getting stuck in the middle of a lightning-storm
      on the small island. Though I was terribly out of shape, I struggled through the Inca Trail near Cuzco, Peru and got to walk
      through the Incan ruins on the Andes mountains into Machu Picchu. I spent 3 summers in Romania for archaeology, and I have 
      to say, it's as beautiful as it is budget-friendly! Though one time, a whole bunch of us got lost overnight in a train station,
      until we all decided to take refuge at the "American Embassy" a.k.a. McDonald's.

    <p>I think I've run outta things to humble-brag about. But if you wanna get lost half-way around the world like me, just let me know!</p>
    <p>Again, just email JuliaC652@yahoo.com. And I'd like to thank CSS Zen Garden for the current website layout!</p>
