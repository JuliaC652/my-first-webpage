  <h1>My Favorite Places</h1>
  <p>
    I believe in traveling on a budget, and as a result, I have gotten to travel all over the world 
    (though Antarctica still won't hire me...yet). If you want to travel somewhere in the world,
    but you believe it's beyond your budget-- just email me at JuliaC652@yahoo.com and we will work on a plan
    to get you there. Where there's a will there's a way.
  </p>

  <p>Anyhow, I've gotten to travel to amazing places like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>England</li>
      <li>Ireland</li>
      <li>Canada</li>
      <li>Spain</li>
      <li>Gibralter</li>
      <li>Denmark</li>
      <li>Sweden</li>
      <li>Finland</li>
      <li>Norway</li>
      <li>Peru</li>
      <li>South Africa</li>
      <li>Zimbabwe</li>

    </ul>
  
  <h2>Highlights</h2>
    <p>
      I went to Oslo on July 22nd, 2011 and accidentally witnessed a terrorist bombing of the capital city.
      I made the mistake of reading <em>On The Road</em> by Jack Karouac right before going to an archaeology field school
      in Menorca, Spain so I ended up stupidly deciding to hitchhike and briefly getting stuck in the middle of a lightning-storm
      on the small island. A macaque stole a package of mini-donuts from some German tourists in Gibraltar and stuffed the 
      whole package in her mouth at once and couldn't chew it. Though I was terribly out of shape, I struggled through the Inca Trail 
      near Cuzco, Peru and got to walk through the Incan ruins on the Andes mountains into Machu Picchu. I spent 3 summers in Romania 
      for archaeology, and I have to say, it's as beautiful as it is budget-friendly! Though one time, a whole bunch of us got lost 
      overnight in a train station, until we all decided to take refuge at the "American Embassy" a.k.a. McDonald's.

    <p>I think I've run outta things to humble-brag about. But if you wanna get lost half-way around the world too, just let me know!</p>

    <h1>My Absolute Favorite Place</h1>
    <p>
      Despite getting to travel all across the world, I've found that the place that I call "home" is by far my favorite.
      Nearly every place I go reminds me of some aspect of Oregon and it's hard not to return to that state. Sometimes,
      when I drive down I-5 anywhere between Eugene and Salem I'm struck by the verdant green hills in the west that rival 
      Ireland's and the Cascade Mountains in the east that are like children of the Carpathians. As often as I travel to 
      Portland, Mount Hood still manages to strike me as a singularly beautiful wonder of nature. Though I traveled through
      the deserts of South Africa, visiting the Cradle of Humanity, I couldn't help but be reminded of the Northern Great
      Basin located in the desert of Eastern Oregon that has evidence of over 16,000 years of human occupation. Though 
      Oregon has its share of problems, I can't help but love it here.
