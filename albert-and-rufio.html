  <h1>Albert & Rufio:</h1>
  <h2>A Dog and A Cat</h2>

  <h3>Albert</h3>
  <p>Picked up from a dog shelter on Christmas Eve when nobody else would take a Pitbull mix puppy.</p>
  <p>Albert is 11 years old but still acts like a puppy. He's got:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A brown and white body</li>
    <li>A pink nose</li>
    <li>Brown eyes</li>
    <li>A habit of stealing your spot on the couch</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All told, Albert is pretty cute and a very expressive dog.</p>

  <h3>Rufio</h3>
  <p>Rufio Augustus Valentino was a kitten I found stuck on a rooftop on Valentine's Day.</p>
  <p>Roof (as I sometimes call him) is 9 years old and pleasantly spoiled. He's got:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A gray and white body</li>
    <li>A loud demeanor (that's how I found him)</li>
    <li>Yellow eyes</li>
    <li>A smug look on his face when you pay him any attention</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Rufio is quite an adorable, dapper cat.</p>

  <p>I was probably supposed to put a numbered list in this assignment, but there are no teachers looking over me, so I'm gonna do what I want.</p>
  <p>Who knows, maybe I'll update this page with pictures if I ever gain any more skills.</p>
